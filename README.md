# Lepak City

A playable, stylised Kuala Lumpur browser prototype. Start at Mamak Maju, collect an order, hop on your kapcai, and deliver it near the twin towers. Earn RM 25, then explore or return for another job.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.12+ (developed with Node 24).

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. The browser renders the 3D world locally with WebGL. No account, API key, remote models, or paid services are required.

```sh
npm run build   # Typecheck and produce dist/
npm run preview
npm test        # Physics/mission tests + Chrome browser gameplay tests
```

The test suite uses an installed Google Chrome through Playwright. On a machine without Chrome, install it or configure Playwright to use its bundled Chromium browser.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| WASD / arrow keys | Walk; accelerate, reverse and steer the bike |
| Shift | Run |
| E | Collect/deliver an order, mount/dismount the bike |
| Space | Brake on the bike |
| Drag | Orbit the camera |
| Scroll | Adjust camera distance |
| C | Re-centre the camera |
| Escape | Pause and settings |

Touch devices get directional and interaction buttons. Desktop with a keyboard is the primary target. Pause settings offer rain, engine/delivery sounds, shadows, and a return-to-mamak recovery action. Returning to the mamak preserves an active order and earnings.

## What's implemented

- Connected 3D streets, KLCC-inspired twin towers and park, mamak, shophouses, trees, Malaysian flags, road markings, and local signage.
- Third-person movement, arcade kapcai driving, wall/furniture/vehicle collision, moving cars, and pedestrians.
- A repeatable delivery mission with a map, world beacon, contextual prompts, and RM 25 payouts.
- Earnings and completed-delivery count in browser local storage. Active mission and position reset on reload.
- Live 3D title screen, responsive HUD, keyboard/touch controls, pause on window blur, and graphics error fallback.
- Procedural models and locally bundled fonts; static scene geometry merged by material.

## Project structure

- `src/world.ts`: procedural environment, people, and vehicles.
- `src/main.ts`: scene, simulation, camera, input, audio, weather, and interface.
- `src/physics.ts`: substepped collision and safe dismount placement.
- `src/mission.ts`: delivery state and rewards.
- `src/style.css`: start screen, HUD, and responsive controls.
- `tests/`: collision and mission tests, desktop delivery end-to-end test, mobile UI smoke test.
- `PLAN.md`: scope and next milestones.

## Current limits and next steps

This is the first playable slice, not a full GTA-scale game. Traffic follows simple routes, pedestrians are ambient, and the bike uses arcade movement rather than rigid-body physics. Rain is visual. Sound is a synthesised engine and delivery chimes. There is no combat, police pursuit, multiplayer, or backend. Mobile UI is tested in browser emulation; performance on physical phones still needs validation.

Next: improve the player/bike animations and street detail, replace selected procedural models with Blender-exported GLB assets, then expand the mission variety. Keep the first delivery playable as assets improve.
